January 2016 Question 1
Question by Brian Dean

Bessie the cow has designed what she thinks will be the next big hit video game: "Angry Cows". The premise, which she believes 
is completely original, is that the player shoots a cow with a slingshot into a one-dimensional scene consisting of a set of hay 
bales located at various points on a number line; the cow lands with sufficient force to detonate the hay bales in close proximity 
to her landing site, which in turn might set of a chain reaction that causes additional hay bales to explode. The goal is to use 
a single cow to start a chain reaction that detonates all the hay bales.

There are N hay bales located at distinct integer positions x1,x2,…,xN on the number line. If a cow is launched with power R 
landing at position x, this will causes a blast of "radius R", engulfing all hay bales within the range x−R…x+R. These hay bales 
then themselves explode (all simultaneously), each with a blast radius of R−1. Any not-yet-exploded bales caught in these blasts 
then all explode (all simultaneously) with blast radius R−2, and so on.

Please determine the minimum amount of power R with which a single cow may be launched so that, if it lands at an appropriate 
location, it will cause subsequent detonation of every single hay bale in the scene.

INPUT FORMAT:
  * Line 1: N (2 <= N <= 50,000)
  * Next N Lines: Integer x1…xN (each in the range 0…1,000,000,000)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  * Line 1: Minimum power R. Answers should be rounded and printed to exactly 1 decimal point.
