December 2018 Question 1
Question by Grace Cai

Farmer John is hosting a new bovine grass-eating convention at his farm! Cows from all over the world are arriving at the local airport to attend 
the convention and eat grass. Specifically, there are N cows arriving at the airport (1 <= N <= 10^5) and cow i arrives at time ti (0 <= ti <= 10^9). 
Farmer John has arranged M (1 <= M <= 10^5) buses to transport the cows from the airport. Each bus can hold up to C cows in it (1 <= C <= N ). Farmer 
John is waiting with the buses at the airport and would like to assign the arriving cows to the buses. A bus can leave at the time when the last cow 
on it arrives. Farmer John wants to be a good host and so does not want to keep the arriving cows waiting at the airport too long. What is the smallest 
possible value of the maximum waiting time of any one arriving cow if Farmer John coordinates his buses optimally? A cow’s waiting time is the difference 
between her arrival time and the departure of her assigned bus.

It is guaranteed that MC >= N.
