February 2017 Question 3
Question by Brian Dean

Why did the cow cross the road? Well, one reason is that Farmer John's farm simply has a lot of roads, making it impossible for his cows to travel around 
without crossing many of them. FJ's farm is arranged as an NÃ—N square grid of fields (2 <= N <= 100), Certain pairs of adjacent fields (e.g., north-south 
or east-west) are separated by roads, and a tall fence runs around the external perimeter of the entire grid, preventing cows from leaving the farm. Cows 
can move freely from any field to any other adjacent field (north, east, south, or west), although they prefer not to cross roads unless absolutely necessary.

There are K cows (1 <= K <= 100,K <= N^2) on FJ's farm, each located in a different field. A pair of cows is said to be "distant" if, in order for one cow to 
visit the other, it is necessary to cross at least one road. Please help FJ count the number of distant pairs of cows.

INPUT FORMAT:
  * Line 1: N, K and R
  * Next R Lines: r,c,r',c' indicating a road between the field at <row r, column c> and adjacent field at <row r', column c'>
  * Next K Lines: Row and column of the K cows

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  * The number of pairs of cows that are distant
