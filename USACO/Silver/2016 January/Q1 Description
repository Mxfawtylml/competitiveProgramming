January 2016 Question 1
Question by Brian Dean

Bessie the cow has designed what she thinks will be the next big hit video game: "Angry Cows". The premise, which she believes is completely 
original, is that the player shoots cows with a slingshot into a one-dimensional scene consisting of a set of hay bales located at various 
points on a number line. Each cow lands with sufficient force to detonate the hay bales in close proximity to her landing site. The goal is 
to use a set of cows to detonate all the hay bales.

There are N hay bales located at distinct integer positions x1,x2,…,xN on the number line. If a cow is launched with power R landing at position 
x, this will causes a blast of "radius R", destroying all hay bales within the range x−R…x+R.

A total of K cows are available to shoot, each with the same power R. Please determine the minimum integer value of R such that it is possible
to use the K cows to detonate every single hay bale in the scene.

INPUT FORMAT:
  * Line 1: N (1 <= N <= 50,000) and K (1 <= K <= 10)
  * Next N Lines: Integers x1…xN (each in the range 0…1,000,000,000)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  * Line 1: The minimum power R with which each cow must be launched in order to detonate all the hay bales.
